VISUAL C++ SERVICE TEMPLATE
===========================
A modern and simplified approach to handeling windows service in C++.
It abstracts away most of the tedious work, all you have to do is subclass WindowsService and define worker

Look at example.cpp for a complete example/template.

Requires VS2015 or later. (Or equivalent build tools)
